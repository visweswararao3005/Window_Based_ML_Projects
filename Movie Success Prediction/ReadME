This project is about Predicting a movie ,based on parameters it predict either Hit or FLop or Average.Here I used 4 Machine Learning They are 
    1 . Naive Bayes Algorithm
    2 . Logistic Regression Algorithm
    3 . SVM Algorithm
    4 . Extension ELM Algorithm

to test my data i Use the algorithm which gives me high Accuracy


The flow of output is in my Linkdin profile
